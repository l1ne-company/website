      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create a <strong>complete cloud ecosystem for NixOS</strong> that keeps
        all the benefits of reproducibility, determinism, and declarative design.
      </p>
      <p>
        With L1ne, developers can build, deploy, and manage NixOS systems natively in the cloud
        without containers or complex orchestration layers. We aim to make the cloud as predictable
        and reliable as Nix itself, where every environment is built from the same verified source.
      </p>

      <h3>What We Believe</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure should be as reproducible as the software it runs</li>
        <li>Determinism beats complexity in production environments</li>
        <li>NixOS deserves native cloud-first tooling</li>
        <li>Containers are an abstraction we can transcend</li>
      </ul>
